 * Creates and configures a MySQL connection pool for managing database connections efficiently.

 * This pool manages a set of connections to the MySQL database, allowing reuse of connections 
 * for better performance and handling concurrent requests without opening new connections repeatedly.
 * Usage:
 * - The pool handles acquiring and releasing connections automatically.
 * - Use `pool.getConnection()` or `pool.query()` to interact with the database.
